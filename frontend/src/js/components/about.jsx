        <p>Three padawans decided to use their skills in ReactJS, Redux, NodeJS, and MongoDB to help aspiring entrepreneurs learn Huttese</p>
        <p>Hutt Stone uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repition</a> algorithm to improve a user's retension of information. Words are presented in Huttese and users are are encoraged to input the equivalent Basic (aka. English) alternative. Once a user has mastered a word, it will appear less and less frequently during training, allowing the user to focus on new words.</p>
